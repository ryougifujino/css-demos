            - By default, the value is `stretch`, which stretches all flex items to fill the parent in
            the direction of the cross axis. **If the parent hasn't got a fixed width** in the cross
            axis direction, then all flex items will become as long as the longest flex items.
            - The `center` value that we used in our above code causes the items to maintain their
            intrinsic dimensions, but be centered along the cross axis.
            - You can also have values like `flex-start` and `flex-end`, which will align all items
            at the start and end of the cross axis respectively.

            `justify-content` controls where the flex items sit on the main axis.

            - The default value is `flex-start`, which makes all the items sit at the start of the
            main axis.
            - You can use `flex-end` to make them sit at the end.
            - `center` is also a value for justify-content, and will make the flex items sit in the
            center of the main axis.
            - The value we've used above, `space-around`, is useful â€” it distributes all the items
            evenly along the main axis, with a bit of space left at either end.
            - There is another value, `space-between`, which is very similar to `space-around`
            except that it doesn't leave any space at either end.
            - `space-evenly` will average each space.

            than items with lower order values.
